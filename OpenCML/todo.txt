Todo:
  -right now:
    Speeding up constructor/desctructor speeds
  -Soon:
    run security tests on code
    add support for CPU based devices 
    Implement optimizations to current convolution code 
            (most threads only use up a small portion of the time allocated to them and thus most of the time in the proram is spent on read/write operations)
    add the data and data set classes to improve end user experience
    add unit tests (this is very difficult to do early on because of the way machine learning works but it can be done TO AN EXTENT)
    test for bugs
    Implement GAN class
    Imorove nonlinearisation methods and add support for more activation fucntions (I should have put more focus on that from the start)


-Eventually: 
  Start experimenting with novel model ideas
  add support for more model types: i.e. bayesian models VSMs and what not
  

done:
