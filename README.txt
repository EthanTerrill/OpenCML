Here it finally is, the public release of the project ive been working on the last year or so, the current release is suffering from a lack of runtime checks 
and a few performance issues which I plan on fixing in the near future which is why Im choosing to name this verison the v0.0 release, 
Unfortunately Ive been pretty busy with school so I cant put an exact date on when I'll make a v1.0 release but the basic plans right now are to add i runtime checks remove
a significant usage of heap memory allocation and generally move towards a system thats more in line with the NASA powers of ten guidelines for reliable code.

I may end up releasing massive overhauls in the distant future depending on how succesfull the project becomes and how much my design philosophy evolves over the next few years 
but the basic plan right now is to add in Datasets and GAN.s and then begin exploring with more layer types and whatever other feutures I decide to add, currently
Im not planning on doing anything with LLM.s like ChatGPT being as I dont personally find them very fascinating from any perspective other than cybersecurity, If you would like
to see support for LLM models feel free to contribute to the repository or send constant nagging requests for new feutures and what not ar ethanrobertterrill@gmail.com

Also Im aware there are lots of bugs and x-platform support issues, Im working on them but my time is split pretty heavily between other projects and school right now
so it might be a while before things start to look nice
